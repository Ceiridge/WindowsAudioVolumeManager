## Features
- Set master volume
- Set & save application volume
- Set default application volume

## What Window's volume mixer does wrong
- Doesn't save application volume
- Sets the volume of new applications to the master volume
- Annoying UX

Note: I accidentally created the git repository in the source folder of the main program, which means that there isn't a .sln file available, although it should be easy to recreate (.NET Core).
